This is a compilation of all my research I have done into the Ring API for use in a Ring Component for Home Assistant and a Ring plugin for Homebridge. Including how to initiate a live view session as well as returning all the recorded sessions. The 
Ring Proccess.txt file includes the layout of their whole API. The Ring SIP sample.txt file includes an example of the data returned in the SIP session, including the links to the RTMP video and audio streams. The Start Live View.txt includes the API calls to start a live view session, which then returns the same data that is listed in the Ring SIP Sample.txt file. If you use any of my research in your work please give me credit. I look forward to seeing all the projects that use any of this.
